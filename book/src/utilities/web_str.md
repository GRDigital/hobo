# web_str

The `web_str` module is just a bunch of commonly used interned strings. It includes all element names, all event names and a bunch of common attributes and values like `class`, `min`, `max`, `checked`, `href`, `readonly`, etc. If something is missing - PRs welcome!

To read more about what is string interning and why is it useful: [wasm-bindgen docs](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/wasm_bindgen/fn.intern.html)
